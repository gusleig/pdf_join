# XLSX PDF Joiner

This little humble script joins an Excel file with a PDF.

The CLI uses one parameter:

```
pdf-xlsx.py -f C:\my_files
```

1. Look for xlsx file 
2. Convert it to PDF
3. Join this new PDF with other in folder.

There are many things to get this better:
- Get all xlsx in folder and iterate, merging all.
